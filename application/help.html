<p>Please read the FAQ thoroughly before asking for support. If you ask something that's answered on here, I'm going to ignore you or call you an idiot depending on my mood.</p>

<h1>FAQ</h1>

<h2>I found an error in your data</h2>

<p>Thank you. Accuracy of the data is important to me. Please open a ticket on GitHub.</p>

<h2>You're missing kobolds/blue dragons/ogres/other obvious thing</h2>

<p>No, I'm not. You've got filters on, or you've turned off a source. If you're absolutely convinced that it's missing, open an issue on GitHub. Be advised that if it isn't missing, my mood's going to be sour and I'm going to call you an idiot.</p>

<h2>Syncing data between computers</h2>

<p>Not possible, and no plans to do that.</p>

<h2>Can you please add [insert some source here]</h2>

<p>No, but you can. See <a href="https://github.com/Asmor/5e-monsters#contributing-content-to-kobold-fight-club">here</a>.</p>

<h2>It's broken! WHAT DO I DO?!</h2>

<p>Clear your cache. "Clear your cache" doesn't mean hard reload. It means go into your browser's settings and clear your cache. If that doesn't help, it's possible your localStorage may have become corrupted. You can clear your local storage by clicking the button below, but be aware that doing so will erase <i>all</i> your saved data</p>

<button id="clearLocalStorage">Clear local storage</button>
<script>
document.getElementById("clearLocalStorage").addEventListener("click", function () {
	localStorage.clear();
}, false);
</script>

<p>If that still doesn't help, open an issue on GitHub. Please include the device you're using, operating system, version of operating system, browser, and version of browser.</p>

<h2>I've got an awesome idea for a feature!</h2>

<p>Search the issues on GitHub to make sure nobody's suggested it yet. If not, please feel free. I make no guarantees.</p>
